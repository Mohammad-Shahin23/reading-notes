## What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?


React Context is a feature in React that allows data to be passed down the component tree without the need to pass props explicitly at each level. 
It helps in managing state and enables data sharing among components without having to use prop drilling (passing data through multiple intermediate components). 
Context is especially useful when certain data needs to be accessed by many components in the application.

## Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component.


useContext Hook:
The useContext Hook is a built-in React Hook that allows functional components to consume data from a React Context. It provides a simple and efficient way to access the value stored in the context object without the need to create a context consumer component.

## Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application.
Purpose of Next.js:
Next.js is a popular framework built on top of React that simplifies the development of server-rendered React applications. 
It aims to provide a great developer experience while maintaining high performance and SEO-friendliness. 
Next.js includes built-in features like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), automatic code splitting, and more, making it an excellent choice for building scalable web applications that require SEO optimization and good performance.
Next.js also supports dynamic imports, allowing you to load components only when needed, reducing the initial bundle size and improving page load times.

Example from Vercel Next.js Examples:
The Vercel Next.js Examples repository showcases various use cases and features of Next.js. 
One such example is "With Apollo," which demonstrates how to integrate Next.js with Apollo GraphQL to build a scalable web application.
