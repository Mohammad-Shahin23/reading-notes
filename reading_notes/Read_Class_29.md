## Explain the purpose and basic structure of Django models. How do they help in creating and managing database schema in a Django application?

Django models serve as the foundation for creating and managing the database schema in a Django application. 
They represent database tables and define the fields and relationships of the data. 
Models provide an object-oriented approach to interact with the database, making it easier to create, retrieve, update, and delete data.ed tools or frameworks.
## Describe the primary features and functionality of the Django Admin interface. How can it be customized to suit the specific needs of a project?
The Django Admin interface is a built-in feature that provides a user-friendly and customizable interface for managing database records.
It offers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for models and automatically generates forms and views for data management. 
The Django Admin can be customized by defining admin classes, allowing developers to control the displayed fields, filters, search functionality, and more to suit the specific needs of a project.

## Briefly outline the key components and workflow of a Django application, as discussed in the Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Django. How do these components interact with each other to create a functional web application?

In a Django application, the key components include models, views, templates, and URLs. 
The workflow typically starts with a URL mapped to a view function, which retrieves data from models and sends it to a template for rendering. 
Templates generate HTML to be displayed to the user. User interactions trigger URL requests that go through the URL configuration to find the associated view and execute the corresponding logic. 
The view retrieves or modifies data through models and renders the appropriate template to generate a response. 
This interaction between components creates a functional web application in Django.
