## What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?
   This question asks about the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how it differs from Jupyter Notebook. It also asks about the main functionalities provided by each tool.
   - A modular architecture that allows users to arrange notebooks, code files, and other related tools in a customizable workspace
   - Support for multiple file formats and output types, including HTML, LaTeX, PDF, and more.
   - Advanced code editing features such as code completion, debugging, and syntax highlighting
    Integration with version control systems like Git and GitHub
## What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?
    NumPy is a powerful Python library for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks. It provides a fast and efficient array processing interface, along with a variety of functions for performing mathematical operations, linear algebra, Fourier analysis, and more. Some of the main functionalities provided by NumPy include:
   - Efficient storage and manipulation of arrays, including multidimensional arrays and matrices
   - Fast numerical operations on arrays, including element-wise operations, matrix multiplication, and more
   - Powerful indexing and slicing capabilities for selecting subsets of data from arrays
    - Advanced mathematical functions, including statistical functions, linear algebra operations, and Fourier transforms
## Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.
    NumPy arrays are homogeneous data structures that store numerical data in a contiguous block of memory. They are similar to Python lists, but offer several advantages, including faster performance and more efficient memory usage
   - Fixed size: The size of a NumPy array is fixed when it is created, and cannot be changed later.
   - Multidimensional: NumPy arrays can have any number of dimensions, and can be used to represent matrices, tensors, and other types of multidimensional data.
   - Broadcasting: NumPy arrays support broadcasting, which allows operations to be performed on arrays of different shapes and sizes.
