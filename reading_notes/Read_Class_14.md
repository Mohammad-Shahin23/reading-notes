## What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.
## Matplotlib:

    -Key features: Matplotlib is a powerful and versatile plotting library that provides fine-grained control over plot customization. It offers a low-level interface for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

    Use cases: Matplotlib is suitable when precise control and customization are required. It serves as the foundation for many other visualization libraries.

    Example visualization: A highly customized line plot with multiple lines, different colors and markers, modified axis scales, and added annotations.

# In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.

## Relational plots:

    scatterplot(): Displays the relationship between two continuous variables by plotting points on a Cartesian plane.

    lineplot(): Shows the trend of a variable over time or another continuous variable.

    lmplot(): Visualizes linear regression models and the associated confidence intervals.

    Example use case: Using scatterplot() to analyze the relationship between a car's horsepower and its miles per gallon (mpg) to determine if there is a correlation.

## Categorical plots:

    barplot(): Compares the values of different categories using rectangular bars.
    countplot(): Displays the frequency of categorical variables as bars.
    boxplot(): Represents the distribution of a quantitative variable across categories using boxes.
    Example use case: Using barplot() to compare the average sales of different products in a store.
## Distribution plots:

    histplot(): Visualizes the distribution of a single variable using histograms.
    kdeplot(): Estimates the probability density function of a variable using kernel density estimation.
    rugplot(): Shows individual data points along an axis.

## What is the purpose of splitting the dataset into train and test sets, and how does this contribute to the evaluation of a machine learning modelâ€™s performance?
   Plotting functions: Summary of main plotting functions categorized by plot types.

    Examples: Concise code examples demonstrating how to create specific plots.

    Customization options: Parameters for customizing plot appearance, such as color palettes, markers, axes labels, and titles.

    Statistical estimation: Incorporating statistical estimation techniques like regression lines or confidence intervals.

    Styling options: Modifying overall plot style with built-in themes and custom styles.

    Color palettes: Overview of different color palettes available for choosing appropriate color schemes.
