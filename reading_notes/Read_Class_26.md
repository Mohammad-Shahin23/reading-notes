## What are the key components of the Django framework, and how do they contribute to building a web application?
- Models: Define the structure and behavior of data.
- Views: Handle the logic behind processing requests and rendering responses.
- Templates: Render the presentation layer, generating HTML to be sent to the client.
- URLs: Map URLs to appropriate views.
- Forms: Handle user input and validation.
- ORM: Object-Relational Mapping for database operations.
- Admin: Pre-built user interface for managing site content.
- Middleware: Process requests and responses before they reach the view.

## Explain the role of Djangoâ€™s MTV (Model-View-Template) architecture and how it handles a typical web request-response cycle.
- Model: Represents the data structure and handles database operations.
- View: Processes requests, performs logic, and interacts with models.
- Template: Renders the presentation layer and generates the final HTML response.
- The MTV architecture separates concerns, making code organization and maintenance easier.
## What is the purpose of Tailwind CSS, and how does it differ from Bootstrap CSS?

### The purpose of Tailwind CSS:
- Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides a set of pre-defined utility classes to quickly  build custom user interfaces.
- It focuses on providing small, composable utility classes that can be combined to create complex styles.
- Tailwind CSS allows for rapid development and flexibility, as it doesn't impose a predefined design style like Bootstrap CSS does.
### Differences between Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap CSS:
- Tailwind CSS is utility-first, while Bootstrap CSS is component-first.
- Tailwind CSS provides a comprehensive set of utility classes that can be applied directly in HTML, whereas Bootstrap CSS offers pre-styled and pre-designed components.
- Tailwind CSS gives developers more control and customization options, while Bootstrap CSS provides a more opinionated and consistent design framework out-of-the-box.
