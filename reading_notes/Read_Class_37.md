# Class Reading 37

## Three key features introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) that improve upon the previous version of JavaScript (ES5) are?

Arrow functions: Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing functions. 
They use the => syntax and have lexical scoping, which means they capture the value of this from their surrounding context. 
This eliminates the need for explicit binding using bind(), call(), or apply(). 
Arrow functions also have implicit return, making them ideal for writing shorter and more readable code.

## After reading “Tailwind in 15 minutes,” can you describe the purpose of utility classes in Tailwind CSS and provide an example of how to use them to style an HTML element?

Template literals: Template literals allow for easier and more flexible string interpolation in JavaScript.
They use backticks () to define strings and allow variables and expressions to be directly embedded using ${}`. 
Template literals also support multi-line strings, making it simpler to write and format multiline text.

## Based on “Why to use Next.js,” explain the main advantages of using Next.js for web development, and provide a brief comparison between traditional client-side rendering and Next.js’s server-side rendering approach.
Destructuring assignment: Destructuring assignment provides a concise way to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables.
 This can significantly simplify code when working with complex data structures and makes it easier to access nested values.
