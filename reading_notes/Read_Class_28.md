## How do Django Forms facilitate user input handling, and what are some key components of creating a form using the Django framework?
Django Forms facilitate user input handling by providing a high-level API for creating HTML forms and handling form validation. 
They abstract away the complexities of handling form data, data validation, and rendering forms in HTML.

To create a form using the Django framework, you typically define a form class that inherits from django.forms.Form or django.forms.ModelForm. 
In this class, you define fields using various field classes like CharField, EmailField, IntegerField, etc. You can also specify validation rules and error messages for each field.
## Explain the purpose of Django Templates in web development and describe how template inheritance can be utilized to improve code reusability and maintainability.

Django Templates are a key component of web development in Django. They provide a way to separate the presentation logic from the application logic. 
Templates allow you to define the structure and layout of your web pages using HTML and include dynamic content using Django's template language. 
The purpose of templates is to generate HTML dynamically based on the data passed to them.
Template inheritance is a powerful feature in Django that improves code reusability and maintainability. With template inheritance, you can define a base template that contains the common elements of your website, such as the header, footer, and navigation. 
This base template can be extended by other templates that inherit its structure and override specific blocks to provide unique content. 
By using template inheritance, you avoid duplicating code and make it easier to maintain consistent designs across your site. Changes made to the base template automatically propagate to all templates that inherit from it.
## Describe the function of Django Views in handling HTTP requests, and outline the differences between function-based views and class-based views.

There are two types of views in Django: function-based views (FBVs) and class-based views (CBVs).

Function-based views are defined as Python functions that accept an HTTP request as a parameter and return an HTTP response. They are simple and straightforward to use for basic scenarios, and the logic resides directly in the view function.

Class-based views, on the other hand, are defined as Python classes that inherit from Django's View or one of its subclasses. They provide a more structured and reusable way of defining views. CBVs offer built-in functionality for common tasks, such as form handling, pagination, and authentication. They promote code reuse through inheritance and allow you to override specific methods to customize behavior.

The main difference between FBVs and CBVs is the way the view logic is organized. CBVs offer a more object-oriented approach, allowing for easier code reuse and separation of concerns, while FBVs are simpler and more straightforward for basic use cases. The choice between the two depends on the complexity of the view and the desired level of code organization and reusability.
