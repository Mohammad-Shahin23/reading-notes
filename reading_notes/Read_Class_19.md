## Explain one automation idea from the assigned material and describe how it can be implemented using Pythonâ€™s regular expressions and shutil libraries.

One automation idea is to create a script that automatically organizes files in a directory based on their file extensions. 
This can be implemented using Python's regular expressions and the shutil library. 
The script can use regular expressions to match file extensions and then move the files to corresponding directories based on their extensions using shutil.move().
