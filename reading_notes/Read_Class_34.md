## The article provides an overview of graphs, a type of non-linear data structure commonly used in computer science. It introduces key terminology associated with graphs:

- Vertex/Node: A data object within a graph that can be connected to other vertices.
- Edge: A connection between two vertices.
- Neighbor: The adjacent vertices connected to a particular vertex.
- Degree: The number of edges connected to a vertex.

## The article then explains the distinction between undirected and directed graphs:

- Undirected Graph: A graph where edges are bi-directional, and there is no specific direction associated with the connections.
- Directed Graph (Digraph): A graph where edges have a direction, indicated by arrows pointing from one vertex to another.

## It further discusses different types of graphs based on their connectivity:

- Complete Graph: A graph where every vertex is connected to all other vertices.
- Connected Graph: A graph where every vertex has at least one edge.
- Disconnected Graph: A graph where some vertices may not have any edges.
## The article also introduces the concepts of acyclic and cyclic graphs:

- Acyclic Graph: A directed graph without any cycles, where a cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex.
- Cyclic Graph: A graph that contains cycles, where a cycle is a closed path within the graph.

## To represent graphs, the article explains two common methods:

- Adjacency Matrix: A 2-dimensional array where rows and columns represent vertices, and the elements indicate whether there is an edge connecting the vertices.
- Adjacency List: A collection of linked lists or arrays where each vertex is associated with a list of its adjacent vertices.

## The article provides visual representations and examples for each representation method.

Overall, the article serves as an introductory guide to graphs, their terminology, types, and different ways to represent them.
