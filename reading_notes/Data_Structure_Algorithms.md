# Data Structures and Algorithms

## 1- What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
    The effectiveness of the data structure for the specific operation(s) that must be performed on the data is one of the most crucial factors to take into account when choosing a data structure for a given problem. For instance, a hash table or a binary search tree would be a good choice if the issue involves many searches; a linked list or a dynamic array might be a better alternative if the issue involves numerous insertions and deletions.

## 2- How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
   1- Make sure the recursive function contains a base case that prevents further recursion. The base case needs to be stated in a way that the recursion finally leads to it.
