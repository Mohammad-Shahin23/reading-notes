## What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?

- Developers write and deploy code without managing underlying server infrastructure.

- Functions are event-driven, triggered by specific events or requests.

- Automatic scaling based on workload, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

- Pay-as-you-go pricing model based on actual usage.

- Reduced operational complexity with the cloud provider managing servers.
## How can one get started with Vercel, and what are the main steps involved in deploying a serverless function using Vercel?
- Create a Vercel account and install the Vercel CLI.

- Write the serverless function code in a supported language (e.g., JavaScript, Python).

- Initialize a new project using the Vercel CLI.

- Deploy the project using the Vercel CLI or connect a Git repository to automate deployments.
- Configure project settings and environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.
- Monitor the deployment status and access the deployed serverless function's URL.

## What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?
- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are interfaces that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other.
- In Python, APIs can be utilized to access and manipulate data from external sources by making HTTP requests to the API endpoints.
- Python libraries like requests simplify the process of interacting with APIs by providing convenient methods for sending HTTP requests and handling responses.
- APIs can be used to retrieve data, update data, perform authentication, and integrate third-party services into Python applications.
## What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?
- The requests library is a popular Python library for making HTTP requests.
- It simplifies sending HTTP requests, handling cookies, headers, and authentication, and processing responses.
