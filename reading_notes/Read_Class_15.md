## analogy

    A tree can be compared to a family tree, where each person represents a node. The root is like the oldest ancestor, and the children are connected to their parent nodes. Just as a family tree helps us understand relationships, a tree data structure organizes and represents hierarchical data in a similar way.
## tree summary 

    Trees: Introduce Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and K-ary Trees, covering common terminology and specifics of each type.

    Common Terminology: Define key terms related to trees, such as node, root, K, left, right, edge, leaf, and height.

    Traversals: Explain the two categories of tree traversals - Depth First and Breadth First.
    Depth First: Discuss Pre-order, In-order, and Post-order traversals, providing examples and sample tree paths.

    Pre-order: Break down the Pre-order traversal method using pseudocode and explain the recursive process.
    Traversal Pseudocode: Present pseudocode for all three Depth First traversals - Pre-order, In-order, and Post-order.

    Breadth First: Describe Breadth First traversal, emphasizing node-by-node iteration at each level of the tree.
    
    Breadth First Traversal: Demonstrate the process using a sample tree and a queue-based approach.
    Pseudocode: Provide pseudocode for implementing Breadth First traversal using a queue.
