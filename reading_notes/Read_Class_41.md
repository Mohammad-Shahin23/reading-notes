## Explain the concept of dynamic routes in Next.js and how they differ from static routes.
Dynamic Routes in Next.js:
In Next.js, dynamic routes allow you to create pages with URLs that depend on external data or parameters. Instead of creating individual pages for every unique combination of parameters, you can use dynamic routes to handle varying data within a single page file. This is particularly useful for building dynamic and data-driven applications. 

## Describe the process of deploying a Next.js application. What are the key steps involved, and what are some deployment platforms you can use?

To define a dynamic route in Next.js, you create a page file inside a folder with square brackets ([]) in its name. The square brackets indicate that the page is dynamic, and the content within the brackets represents the dynamic parameter. For example, if you want to create a dynamic route for blog posts with slugs, you would create a file named [slug].js inside the pages directory.

Dynamic routes are handled by Next.js server-side, and the parameters are accessible in the component through the useRouter hook. For example, if you want to access the slug parameter from the URL, you would use useRouter().query.slug.

## How does Next.js handle static file serving? Discuss the default folder structure for storing static assets and explain how to reference them in a Next.js application.

Next.js will automatically handle optimizations and serve these assets efficiently. The assets in the public folder are not processed by the Next.js build system and are directly served by the server or the CDN, making them efficient for static files that do not require dynamic processing.
