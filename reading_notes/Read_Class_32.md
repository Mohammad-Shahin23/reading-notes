## What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?



- Authentication: It determines the identity of the user making the API request. DRF supports various authentication methods such as session-based authentication, token-based authentication, OAuth, etc.

- Authorization: It specifies what actions a user can perform on a particular resource. DRF provides several authorization classes like IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser, and AllowAny, among others, which can be used to define access rules.

- Permissions: They define the fine-grained control over access to API endpoints. Permissions can be assigned at the model level (object-level permissions) or at the view level (view-level permissions). DRF offers default permission classes like IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly and DjangoModelPermissions, and you can also create custom permission classes to suit your application's requirements.

## in SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?

In SQL, the SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database table. Its purpose is to query and fetch specific data records or columns based on specified criteria. To retrieve all columns from a table called 'employees', you would use the following SQL statement:

    SELECT * FROM employees;


## Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?

DRF Generic Views provide a set of pre-built view classes that simplify the process of building RESTful APIs. They encapsulate common patterns and functionalities, reducing the amount of code needed to create API views. The main advantage of using Generic Views is that they promote code reusability and follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

Here are a few examples of DRF Generic Views:

- ListAPIView: This view is used to retrieve a list of objects from a model and serialize them. It corresponds to the GET method on a collection resource.

- RetrieveAPIView: It retrieves a single object from a model and serializes it. This view maps to the GET method on a single resource.

- CreateAPIView: This view allows creating new objects in the model. It corresponds to the POST method.

- UpdateAPIView and DestroyAPIView: These views handle updating and deleting objects, respectively. They correspond to the PUT/PATCH and DELETE methods.

By subclassing these Generic Views and providing the necessary configuration, such as the model to operate on and the serializer class to use, you can quickly create CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for your API. This reduces boilerplate code and provides consistent behavior across different API endpoints.
