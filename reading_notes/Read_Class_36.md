## What are the key pieces of advice mentioned in the “Whiteboard Advice” reading assignment for successfully tackling whiteboard interviews?

- Restate the question: Before solving the problem, restate the question to ensure understanding and get affirmation from the interviewer.

- Ask about edge cases: Discuss potential edge cases to demonstrate attention to detail and analytical thinking.

- Inquire about test cases: Ask if there are specific test cases to consider, showing familiarity with testing practices.

- Write pseudocode and validate: Outline pseudocode to express your logic, discuss it with the interviewer to ensure correctness.

- Write the actual code: Translate pseudocode into actual code, asking for help if needed.

## From the “6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview” article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview?

- Take a few minutes: Instead of immediately jumping into solving the problem and talking at the same time, take a moment to think in silence. 
After the interviewer explains the problem, ask for permission to take a minute or two to think and gather your thoughts. 
Use this time to analyze the problem, decide on an approach, and come up with a basic solution. 
Then, communicate your conclusions to the interviewer, providing your reasoning behind the chosen approach. Taking this brief pause allows for concentrated thought and helps you deliver a more structured and coherent response.

- Write down the steps of the solution: Once you have an idea of how to approach the problem, resist the temptation to start writing code immediately. 
Instead, write down the general steps or high-level algorithm of your solution on one side of the whiteboard where it is visible but not in the way. 
This step helps you organize your thoughts and ensure that you have a clear plan in mind before diving into coding. 
It also allows the interviewer to follow your thought process and see the overall logic of your solution. 
The focus here is on outlining the steps in a readable and logical manner rather than writing fully detailed code.
